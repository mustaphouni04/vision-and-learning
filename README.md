A set of projects in the course of Vision &amp; Learning  

## ANPR
The focus of this research is identifying and recognizing Spanish license plates, typically used to retrieve data from a vehicle database about specific cars. 
In this project, we experiment with multiple pipelines and algorithms for Automatic Number-Plate Recognition (ANPR). This is done to benchmark each possible technique/methodology and to be able to perform comparisons.
